    "**Answer: **\n",
    "From the 3 tables above, we can make several important conclusions. First, the prediction time of SVC and decistion tree are both very small, while the random forest is much larger. I think the reason might be that the random forest tree will take a random subset of the data each time, as well as the random subset of the features for training for each estimator (tree). For the prediciton, it also needs to compute the result for each estimator, and do the majority voting if it is a classification problem, and the mean calculation if it is a regression problem. Therefore, it requires a lot more work for the prediction. But the benifit is it will have much less overfitting, compared to the decision tree classifier. From the table it also shows that the testing F1 score for random forest is higher than that for the decision tree. As for the SVC, the prediction time and the F1 score is in the middle. But the implementation of SVC, at least in Scikit Learn, is not very efficient. According to the documentation: \"The implementation is based on libsvm. The fit time complexity is more than quadratic with the number of samples which makes it hard to scale to dataset with more than a couple of 10000 samples.\"\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "For this particular case, I would use either SVC or random forest. Both would give a good testing F1 score, and since the data size in this example is not big, SVC is efficient. And the prediction time for random forest is not very bad either. I ended up using the random forest."

    "<br><br>\n",
    "Decisoin tree(fitted model), many times binary decision trees, would have one root node and several child nodes. The predicting process starts at the root node. On each node, the model has a specific decision to make. If the answer to that decision is \"yes\", it will go the the node's left child, otherwise it will go to the right child node. And this procedure continues until the model hits the leaf node, which is the final output class or the final decision of the model. Therefore, all the nodes except the leaf nodes are like the decision choice process. For example, one node might look like the following: If \"romantic\" is true then go to the left child, otherwise go to the right child.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Decision tree is simple and fast, but it will easily overfit. In order to avoid this, random forest would typically have multiple decision trees. For each tree, it will take a random subset of the training data, as well as a random subset of the features to fit. On prediction, the model will compute the result for each tree, and do the majority vote if it is a classification problem, or take the mean value if it is a regression problem."
