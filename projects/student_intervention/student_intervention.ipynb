    "From the 3 tables above, we can make several important conclusions. First, the prediction time of SVC and decistion tree are both very small, while the random forest is much larger. I think the reason might be that the random forest tree will take a random subset of the data each time, as well as the random subset of the features for training for each estimator (tree). For the prediciton, it also needs to compute the result for each estimator, and do the majority voting if it is a classification problem, and the mean calculation if it is a regression problem. Therefore, it requires a lot more work for the prediction. But the benifit is it will have much less overfitting, compared to the decision tree classifier. From the table it also shows that the testing F1 score for random forest is higher than that for the decision tree. As for the SVC, the prediction time and the F1 score is in the middle. But the implementation of SVC, at least in Scikit Learn, is not very efficient. According to the documentation: \"The implementation is based on libsvm. The fit time complexity is more than quadratic with the number of samples which makes it hard to scale to dataset with more than a couple of 10000 samples.\"\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "For this particular case, I would use either SVC or random forest. Both would give a good testing F1 score, and since the data size in this example is not big, SVC is efficient. And the prediction time for random forest is not very bad either. I ended up using the random forest."

    "In order to explain how random forest works, we need to understand how decision tree works. How these models fit the data is beyond the scope of this discussion, we only explain how they will make predictions, after they fit the training data. Here we only briefly mention how decision tree is trained. Decision tree will, at each step, try to come up with some rules to split the data up, so that after such a step, it would gain most of the information. And this process keeps going for many steps. How to split up the data at each step is based on something called \"information gain\" which is beyond the scope, but one can just think of it as an algorithm with which the decision tree could use to gain most of the information.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Decisoin tree(fitted model), would typically go through a sereis of two-option choices questions to make predictions. For example, a sample decision tree might have a starting point such as \"Is the 'romantic' variable True or False?\" True means the student is involved in a relationship, False otherwise. This is a two-option question. If the answer is True acordding to the given data point, then the process would go to the \"left branch\" with another binary questions such as \"Is the variable 'health' True or not?\", othwerwise if the answer is False then it will go to the \"right branch\" with another different question. This procudure will continue until the tree hits its \"leave\" node, which means there is no question available. Finally, the tree will make prediction based on all of the answers provided by the given data point.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Decision tree is simple and fast, but it will easily overfit. In order to avoid this, random forest would typically have multiple decision trees. For each tree, it will take a random subset of the training data, as well as a random subset of the features to fit. On prediction, the model will compute the result for each tree, and do the majority vote if it is a classification problem, or take the mean value if it is a regression problem. Majority voting process is something like a voting in real life: if more than half of the people vote that it should belong to class 1 instead of 2, then it is class 1."
